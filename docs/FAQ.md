## Getting Help 

#### Q: Does this work for motioneye remote cameras?

Yes and no.. motioneye-telegram needs access to the media files. therefor, you have to install and configure motioneye-telegram on remote cameras as you have to do it on 'master' installs. motioneye is only showing the stream of remote cameras but is not storing it locally. this is why installing it to remote cameras is the only way to get notified.
